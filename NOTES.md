### virtualenv

```
$ virtualenv venv --python=python3
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ deactivate
```

I had a problem with permissions installing serverless through node:

```
$ npm install -g serverless
```

So I removed node and npm

```
$ sudo apt-get purge node
$ sudo apt-get autoremove
```

And I installed nvm

https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

```
$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.37.0/install.sh | bash
$ nvm install --lts
$ nvm ls 14
$ nvm alias default 14.15.1
```

Hee's how to list all global packages in a version

```
$ npm list -g --depth 0
```

files added when setting up serverless for autocomplete.  I said no to 
"We will install completion to ~/.bashrc, is it ok ?"  but was not able to entirely cancel tab completion setup.

$ python -m pip install pymongo[snappy,aws,gssapi,srv,tls]
there were errors.  ended up doing
$ python -m pip install pymongo


list python packages
$ pip list

$ pip freeze > requirements.txt

$ sls wsgi serve

### Logging

https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#logging-advanced-tutorial

```
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

"This means that logger names track the package/module hierarchy, and itâ€™s intuitively obvious where events are logged just from the logger name."

also:

"[`Logger.setLevel()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.Logger.setLevel) specifies the lowest-severity log message a logger will handle"

### Running Locally

```
serverless wsgi serve
```

### Using requirements.txt

list packages in requirements.txt:

```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

install packages from requirements.txt:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
